    <h1>Rules of the game</h1>
    <p>The game is to be played by two players. A high score is set and the first player to reach the preset high score wins the game. Any player who roles a 1 loses all of their current score but a player might decide to hold, which gives the player the opportunity to retain their present score but lose a turn to the next player</p>
